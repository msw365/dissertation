\section{Mechanical licensing of cellular activities}

Ideas:
- Compare to neuronal firing

- "Many immune receptors are mechanosensitive"

Formats:
- Based on this paper, it seems plausible that...

- It remains unknown 


Directions:
- Importance of mechanobiology in developmental biology

- Other speculative integrins

- Other speculative functions that mechanical activity can contribute to

- Different antigen sensitivities

- Exhausted T cells

- Speculation on the role of mechanobiology in engineered T cells

- Speculate on particular moleucles or signaling axes

- Other immune cell types

Appendix ideas:

- Relevance of our in vitro system? Stiffnesses? The limitations of nterrogating a moleucle's biomechanology independently of its biochemistry?
