\section{Conclusion} 

For my doctoral work, I performed research investigating the mechanoregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing. Together, we found that CTLs form synaptic actin protrusions against target cells \cite{Tamzalit2018}. This act sensitizes the target cell to perforin lysis and granzyme entry, heightening the overall cytotoxic effector response. This potentiation is molecularly controlled by the actin nucleation promoting factors WASP and WAVE2, which are concentrically organized (from the center to the periphery, respectively). WASP promotes central actin protrusions associated with lytic granule fusion and content release, while WAVE2 is linked with peripheral actin protrusions and robust conjugate formation. Phenotypically, the increased application of force against targets is associated with an overall better effector response. This biomechanical force-effector relationship again appears in our model of degranulation, in which T cells use mechanical signals via integrins to home their lytic granules towards synaptic 'hotspots' in a novel manner that is distinct from their canonical signaling capacity through focal adhesions. These synaptic sites of granule fusion are immunologically verified to be foreign and accordingly sensitized to perforin. Although our data is supports this model and is in line with published work in the field, there are key outstanding questions to be answered. A discussion of some of these questions and how the results of my thesis work might inform future studies follows.

\subsection{Integrin focal adhesions}

We established a necessary mechanical requirement for integrin-mediated degranulation, but much work remains to be done in characterizing how other molecules in focal adhesion machinery contribute to degranulation. Vinculin is a cytoskeletal molecule that consists of a head region that binds to talin or $\alpha$-actenin, and a tail region that binds to f-actin, lipids, and paxillin \cite{Goldmann2002}. Vinculin is regulated by phosphoinositide expression and reinforces the connection between talin and the f-actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing the mechanical action on integrins and talin \cite{Ezzell1997, Goldmann2002}. As the disruption of vinculin activity is known to affect the capacity of T cells to form proper focal adhesions and adhere \cite{Goldmann2002}, it would be a good place to begin investigation of focal adhesion machinery to degranulation using genetic means of perturbation and measuring force exertion and cytotoxic capacity using similar methods and techniques as described in Chapter \ref{chap:chapter3} (e.g. CRISPR, DNA MTP force experiments, TCR signaling, etc.). Of course, any of the other components of focal adhesions are also fair game for study.

In Chapter \ref{chap:chapter3}, we hypothesized that the outside-in mechanical activity of LFA-1 drove lytic granule fusion at the synapse. However, one outstanding question is the respective contributions of inside-out vs. outside-in signaling of integrins to degranulation homing. As we used methods that would abolish both inside-out and outside-in signaling, experiments that only perturb the outside-in signaling would be necessary. One possible method could involve the rescue of inside-out signaling after talin knock out via CRISPR by overexpressing the talin-head domain only which has been carefully characterized in the literature to rescue inside-out signaling \cite{Ciobanasu2018, Elliott2010, Ellis2014}. The talin head domain will bind to the cytosolic tail of the $\beta$-integrin domain and trigger inside-out signaling (see ref{fig:lfa} for further detail) but be unable to bind the actin cytoskeleton, which is mediated by the tail domain. We predict that T cells that have been depleted for talin but express the talin-head domain will have active conformation LFA-1 on the surface and be able to adhere and form synapses, but be unable to home and fuse lytic granules at the synapse. Other alternative approaches could involve the use of the mangnese ion ($Mn^{2+}$) , which is known to stabilize the MIDAS domain of LFA-1 \cite{Meijne1994, Sen2018, Dixit2011}, to stablize the LFA-1/ICAM-1 function and yield more mechanical force, possibly enhancing degranulation.

\subsection{Optimizing degranulation to escape T cell suicide}
The observation that T cells tend to granulate at pillar tops (see Figure \ref{fig:fig2degranulation}) aligns with existing knowledge in the field that lytic granules require actin hypodense/cleared regions for membrane fusion \cite{Ritter2015}.  However, the transient burst of f-actin associated with the moment of degranulation (Figure \ref{fig:fig2degranulation}) is ripe to consider.  It could be associated with a burst of local mechanopotentiating synaptic force,  generating actin-flow mediated traction force to potentiate integrin granule homing (Figure \ref{fig:fig4model}). It could also be involved in actively polymerizing f-actin polymers, creating actin-rich micro-protrusions/structure at a resolution scale below detection via confocal microscopy. FRET-based actin polymerization probes could be used to interrogate if T cells were creating microdomains of actin polymerization at sites of degranulation,  as Lifeact-GFP only detects mature f-actin.  Other strategies involve photobleaching f-actin and watching its recovery (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, or FRAP) \cite{Simon1988} relative to where cells degranulate, or using a fluorescent WASP, WAVE2, or Arp2/3 probe to monitor the relative location of actin nucleation promoting factors to lytic granule secretion \cite{Obino2016, Tamzalit2018}. 

Additional cytotoxic benefits may also be realized by degranulating at the base of actin-rich protrusions. Given the the concave orientation of the protrusion 'pit' relative to the corresponding target cell surface, we hypothesize that the perforin molecule preferentially binds to convex lipid membrane curvatures, due to its the  asymmetric, "key-like" sterics \cite{Law2010}. We could directly test this hypothesis by adapting gramicidin-based techniques from studies on fluorescence-based small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) \cite{Ingolfsson2010,  Polozov2001}. Lipids will be constituted in buffer containing the fluorophore 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-Trisulfonic Acid (ANTS) and one of its quenchers p-Xylene-Bis-Pyridinium Bromide (DPX) to reform into large multilamellar vesicles (LMVs). Preference for convexity will be tested by treating the fluorescent SUVs with perforin, triggering oligomerization with calcium in the reaction buffer, and then measuring the amount of liberated fluorescence as a marker for pore formation. We expect the group in which perforin engages a convex lipid membrane to liberate more fluorophore than the group in which perforin engages a concave lipid membrane. Preference for concavity will be tested by constituting perforin into SUVs and triggering oligomerization and fluorophore leakage using A23187, a small molecule calcium ionophore (this ionophore can similarly be added to the convexity sample for full control).  Should it bear out that perforin has a preference for convex lipid membranes, it might potentially explain how T cells avoid being killed by their own secreted perforin, which remains an outstanding question in the field.

\subsection{SNARE complex crosstalk to integrins}
SNARE proteins are a large family of proteins that are responsible for mediating vesicle fusion and are directly responsible for the fusion of lytic granules \cite{Chang2017}.  SNARE proteins are localized to the vesicle membrane or target membranes and are called v- and t-SNARES, respectively \cite{Yoon2018}. Synaptobrevin2 is the v-SNARE and syntaxin11 is the t-SNARE that mediates lytic granule fusion in cytotoxic lymphocytes \cite{Halimani2014, Chitirala2019, Matti2013}. The Habc domain of the Q-SNARE domain folds back and allows the interaction between the v-SNARE and the t-SNARE, forming a \textit{trans-}SNARE complex \cite{Yoon2018}.  The SNARE activating function is regulated by Munc18 \cite{Spessott2017, Yoon2018, Baker2015}. Finally, the R-SNARE binds to the trimeric complex, forming a mature SNARE complex that works as a molecular zipper to bring the vesicle and plasma membranes closer together for fusion \cite{Agostino2017}.

It is likely that the finely tuned LFA-1 mediated mechanical homing of degranulation is communicated to the t-/v-SNARE complex, as SNARE complexes themselves are mechanosensitive \cite{Risselada2020}. One group observed that neuronal SNARE complexes placed under tension (around 10 pN) can maintain a partially-assembled form in which the v- and t-SNARES are in a 'frayed' state \cite{Zhou2017}. The observed mechanoregulation of SNARE complexes suggests that their mechanical activity can lead to increased biological activity (higher formation of the fusion stalk and vesicle fusion), but has yet to be directly tested in immune/T cells. There are reports of functional associations between the SNARE complex and integrin-mediated recycling at the membrane \cite{Riggs2012, Zhuang2020, Nagy2009}, but whether or not any signaling molecules liase in-/directly between the two signalosomes remains unclear and would be a fecund area for future study. 

To investigate possible integrin mechano-crosstalk to the SNARE complex, we could investigate the Munc-family group of proteins, known regulators of t-/v-SNARE fusion \cite{Ma2011, Yoon2018}. Two possible candidates to study are Munc13-1 and Munc18-1 proteins, which are in direct control of the assembly of SNARE complex components \cite{Diao2010} and have been studied extensively in neuronal synapses. In neurons, Munc18-1 activity is directly regulated by diacylglycerol and PKC$\theta$, bearing two PKC$\theta$ phosphorylation sites that, when phosphorylated, induces fusion of vesicles bearing neurotransmitters \cite{Genc2014, Nagy2009, Korogod2007}. Munc13-1 bears a C1 diacylglycerol binding domain \cite{Song1999} and markedly accelerates the kinetics of this interaction and vesicle fusion \cite{Ma2011, Song1999}. Whether or not outside-in signaling from integrins affects SNARE fusion could be tested by knocking out talin in T cells (using the gRNA we characterized in Chapter \ref{chap:chapter3}) profiling the phosphorylation of the Munc18-1 protein against T cells transduced with a non-targeting control gRNA. Additionally, one could track the localization of integrins and Munc13-1 at the synapse (using fluorescent probes) in response to a photoactivated TCR \cite{Huse2007}, which is known to induce diacylglycerol localization \cite{Quann2009}. If there is crosstalk, photoactivation of the TCR should induce integrin localization. One could even test the mechanical strength's influence over Munc13-1 (and by proxy, SNARE localization) by generating photoactivatable agonists on peptides of different TCR signal strengths (i.e. different primary sequences), which are known to induce different mechanical strengths \cite{VanderMerwe2001, Ma2010, Ma2012, Lanzavecchia1999}. These experiments would be illuminating to see if mechano-regulation of integrins directly affects SNARE complex formation and function for lytic granule fusion.

\subsection{TCR signaling strength and integrin-mediated degranulation}

The mechanical activity of integrins is regulated by TCR signaling strength, as  force experiments in our lab and others on force-measuring surfaces without stimulatory peptide have indicated \cite{Ma2012, Feng2018, Chen2013, Harrison2019}. Different peptides presented in MHC are capable of stimulating different TCR signaling strengths as well \cite{Moran2011}. These observations lead us to ask how TCR signaling strengths affect integrin clustering and if there is a minimal number of integrin clusters needed for degranulation. Experimental techniques designed to ask the same question of minimal number of TCRs needed for T cell activation could be adapted to answer this question, such as restricting the clustering of integrins to test minimal requirements for degranulation \cite{Hashimoto-Tane2016, Labrecque2001, Manz2011}. 

Another outstanding question is how physiologically relevant the OT-1/OVA-SIINFEKL peptide system is, given its high TCR signaling strength \cite{Moran2011}. For this question, one could repeat the experiments outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:chapter2} and Chapter \ref{chap:chapter3} using a model peptide system more similar to what T cells encounter \textit{in vivo}. However, given that mechanical defects in human cells also produce lowered immune responses (such as in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or HIV \cite{Houmadi2018}), we expect the results to be similar.

\subsection{Fas-ligand mediated cytotoxicity}

Although the T cell primarily kills through the secretion of perforin and granzyme \cite{Yasukawa2000}, T cells have other ways in killing target cells as well. A well-known alternative pathway is the Fas ligand (FasL) pathway.  Binding of FasL against the Fas receptor (FasR, or CD95) leads to the formation of a trimeric "death-inducing signaling complex"(DISC) FasL-FasR complex \cite{Yamada2017}. Upon aggregation of DISCs and corresponding FasL-FasR downstream signaling,  caspases 2, 3, 8, and 9 are released leading to DNA degradation, membrane blebbing, and apoptosis \cite{Parlato2000, Yamada2017}. Fascinatingly, Fas ligand has been observed to localize to cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzyme \cite{Kojima2002}, with some groups even reporting a distinct granule subsets that contain Fas but no perforin or granzymes \cite{Chang2017, Schmidt2011, Schmidt2011_2}. 

From the perspective of this study,  a natural question to consider is whether or not subpopulations of granules are segregated mechanically and for what purpose they might be. Probably the first pair of questions to investigate is whether or not Fas ligand or Fas receptor signaling is mechanically regulated, which could be studied using the techniques used in this study. One study has observed co-immunoprecipitation of FasR with ezrin, a known linker molecule to the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that FasR could be mechanically regulated \cite{Parlato2000}. To directly test this hypothesis, one could imagine an experiment involving placing Fas-receptor positive target cells expressing fluorescent probes for the Fas-receptor mediated apoptosis pathway (e.g. caspases) onto traction force microscopy-compatible micropillars (thinner). These pillars could be coated with adhesive proteins and Fas ligand, which could trigger FasL-mediated apoptosis. Colocalization studies of caspases against areas of target cell force exertion could be informative.

\section{Future directions}

This study attempted to comprehensively cover the mechanobiology of cytotoxicity (Chapter \ref{chap:chapter2}) and lytic granule secretion (Chapter \ref{chap:chapter3}), which are important but still ultimately only one region of the T cell field of study. What follows is an informed discussion of the future of mechanobiology as it pertains to \textit{other} T cell fields of study, and how the author speculates how the field of mechanobiology might change in the years to come.

\subsection{Population-scale CTL force dynamics}

Going forward, it would be interesting to investigate dynamics of synaptic force exertion in a single CTL against a target cell. In particular, one wonders if the CTL at first pass deploys a standard range of force exertion and protrusion-type or cellular structure (in a "probing phase"), and then must dynamically change its range of force exertion or arsenal of structures for force exertion according to local biostructural architecture (i.e. what is the lifetime force action of a standard CTL encounter?). Certainly these events are correspondingly influenced by the signaling molecules present at the synapse, each of which live their own biophysical lives by mere virtue of their presence. Answering such questions would require direct interrogation of a live CTL-target cell synapse. Previous technologies for measuring membrane tension include atomic force microscopy or an optical trap - but both remain insufficiently precise to monitor real-time \textit{in vitro} or \textit{in vivo} synapse dynamics. Certain fluorescence-based technologies have been recently been developed in order to measure synapse dynamics that ignore restrictive planar geometries \cite{Vorselen2020}. Combined with fluorescent probes, the use of these microparticles could elucidate "phases" of the T cell physical response as it (putatively) probes, adheres, degranulates, kills, and releases, the target cell.

Thinking outside the context of single-T cell force exertions, it would be fascinating to investigate the host CTL-ome at large, if certain "battalions" or "legions" of CTLs exist, organized according to their physical strengths and effector capabilities. Certainly a reasonable first-pass method of organization is expression levels of certain effector genes and molecules (e.g. \textit{Prf}, \textit{Grzb}, \textit{Ifng}), but these measures obviously omit the  mechanoregulation of these molecules and thus miss their effects in totality. One would require experimental techniques capable of not only measuring single-cell T cell force exertion \textit{en masse}, but also the possible swarm behavior of responding T cells in which an initial "less capable" group of T cells is replaced by stronger effector cells (or weaker, in a "clean up" phase). Certain molecular perturbation platforms that are designed to measure CRISPR-based perturbations at the protein level \cite{Wroblewska2018} come closer to characterizing all of the effects that a molecular perturbation truly encompasses. Other platforms for monitoring infiltrating immune cells into locally perturbed regions of the tumor microenvironment also exist \cite{MaximeDhainaut2021}. One could imagine choosing a tumor system for this platform that has been spatially perturbed heterogeneously for known cytoskeletal/cell stiffness molecules and investigate how T cells of well-characterized strengths segregate (and presumably kill). Characterizing T cell swarm or group behavior would be a massive undertaking that would take many years to perform.

Many of the experiments conducted in order to complete this doctoral thesis were performed using \textit{in vitro} systems. These systems were designed to interrogate force activity by holding the force threshold constant (e.g. micropillars, DNA membrane tension probes), while observing the cell's force activity in time. While these arrangements are useful for ease of investigation, holding constant a variable as broad as the force threshold creates major scientific blind spots even in real-time studies (much less bulk studies via co-culture assays). This is true particularly in studies focused on the effector cell, in which the arrangement ignores half of the cellular conversation: the target cell \cite{Tello-lafoz2021}. The target cell is capable of dynamically responding to the effector cell's efforts to kill (presumably in a cooperative or antagonistic manner), which is entirely neglected in these experimental systems. 

\subsection{The mechanobiology of exhausted T cells}

To date, there has been no direct study of mechanobiology of exhausted T cells. Nevertheless, given what we know about the immunological behavior of exhausted T cells and how mechanobiological principles influence these behaviors in other T cell contexts (such as na{\"i}ve, proliferating, or activated T cells), we can comfortably speculate on how we might think mechanical principles might influence exhausted T cell (dys)function.

The label 'exhausted T cells' can be quite wide, but general agreement can be found in a definition that includes a molecular signature of increased inhibitory receptor expression, such as B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), eomesodermin (Eomes), and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) \cite{Wherry2011, Quigley2010, Keir2008, Doering2012, Wherry2007, Wang2012,  Lazarevic2013, Rangachari2012, Shin2009, Paley2012, Larsson2013}. In particular, exhausted T cells are strongly associated with a $PD-1^{hi}$ phenotype \cite{Keir2008}. Persistent antigen stimulation in the context of chronic infection triggers epigenetic alternations to the \textit{Pdcd1} locus, resulting in this higher surface expression of the PD-1 inhibitory receptor. The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis is known to attenuate TCR activation \cite{Mizuno2019}, proliferation \cite{Schietinger2014}, and T cell migration \cite{Zinselmeyer2013}. Although direct evidence is needed, it seems reasonable to suggest that exhausted T cells might display diminished physical capacity, further dampening their effector capabilities.

TCR mechanical signaling is a known requirement for T cell activation \cite{Hu2016}.

Exhausted T cells also present a diminished metabolic state. Accordingly, it is likely that their effector capacity is severely weakened, considering that cytoskeletal remodeling is a highly energy intensive activity. Reports on the energy dynamics of actin-polymerization inhibited cells indicate that ATP consumption is up to 50\% slower \cite{Bernstein2002, Ahmed2015}. Depletion of glucose/ATP from the medium also immobilizes the motor protein myosin \cite{Xu2014}, which is known to be involved in potentiating lytic granule fusion \cite{Basu2016}.

\subsection{Mechanically enhancing the success of engineered T cells}

There has been some study of the CAR immune synapse, although it remains in the preliminary stages and the relationship between the unique organization of the CAR IS and CAR efficiency have yet to be fully explored. Most strikingly, the CAR IS does not present an annular bull's eye structure, which is a characteristic feature of TCR IS.  The organization of the actin ring in CAR IS is poor, and actin may not be not completely diminished at the center of CAR IS \cite{Xiong2018}, which may disrupt smooth granule secretion. LFA-1 is disorganized and MHC-bound CAR microclusters are randomly distributed at the CAR IS \cite{Davenport2019}. While TCR IS forms a bull's eye's structure in  5–10 min, the CAR IS induces significant CAR-proximal signaling much faster (\textless 2 min), suggesting that CARs may not need to form these stable structures. 

Another important part of IS biology is the delivery of cytotoxic granules, including perforin and granzymes, to the IS mediated by MTOC \cite{Mukherjee2017}. The rapid proximal signaling of CAR IS also induces  MTOC migration to the IS and accelerates the delivery of granules \cite{Davenport2019}. Although the mechanisms of CAR IS have gradually been revealed, it is still unclear whether the differences in CAR IS structure correlate with the efficacy of CAR T cells \cite{Li2020, Watanabe2018}. 

Much work remains to be done to achieve the full potential of CARs as a sure and accessible therapy. Despite significant public and private sector effort in designing and developing novel cancer immunotherapies, these efforts are almost ubiquitously underappreciate the biomechanical aspects of T cell killing, which play a large role in their cytotoxicity. In addition to their effector function,T cells participate in mechanical communication throughout their entire lifecycle, surveying organs and tissues for foreign cells and experiencing both harsh and forgiving physical environments such as the shear force of lymphatic transport or the broad range tissue stiffnesses that exist within the body. These biomechanical properties are significantly altered in disease states. T cells take significant cues from their mechanical environment in their activity, altering their development, differentiation, migration, activation, and effector functions, all of which can tip the balance of successful vs. unsuccessful immune system clearance of pathogens or cancers. Biomechanical communication has been extensively studied at a fundamental research, but the knowledge yielded has yet to reach a significant level of incorporation in immunotherapy design for both knowledge-based and practical reasons. Genetically modifying the cancer cell is near impossible, and the \textit{ex vivo} modification of T cells remains exceedingly expensive and inaccessible. 

Nonetheless, growing knowledge of T cell mechanobiology has enabled the  creation of mechanically-based engineering strategies to modulate T cell immunity, a nascent field termed “mechanical immunoengineering”. Mechanical immunoengineering takes advantage of biomechanical cues such as stiffness and external forces in order to modulate T cell proliferation and effector functions for therapeutic applications. Of course, this is in complement to well-established modes of modulating biochemical cues such as antigen recognition (chimeric antigen receptors) and co-stimulatory signals (checkpoint blockade) that curate the anti-tumor T cell immune response and enhance therapeutic efficacy. For example, stiffer antigen-presenting matrices have been shown to enhance T cell proliferation independently of the intensity of biochemical stimulatory signals \cite{Lei2020} and can be adapted and used \textit{ex vivo} in order to improve patient outcomes. Fabrication of planar surfaces presenting T cell ligands has demonstrated that focal clustering of TCR can be inhibited by presenting antigens in a hollow ring configuration, which in turn reduces IFN$\gamma$ and proliferation of T cells \cite{Schraml2015}. In contrast, TCR clustering signaling can be promoted by introducing regions of ligand for multi-valent receptor binding on the activating surface, which boosts the effector function of T cells \cite{OConnor2012, Schraml2015}.  These studies suggest that spatial organization of the TCR clusters control the T cell response,  which should strongly inform the design of these immunoengineering strategies \cite{Aramesh2019}.

A recent report details the development of a CAR T cell that upon activation, secretes an enzyme that cleaves the adminstered pro-drug for localized drug administration \cite{Gardner2021}. This platform could be adapted in other immune cells in order to make the local immune environment more stiff, thereby mechanically potentiating T cell activation and effector function.

\subsection{Nuclear mechanotransduction}

The T cell nucleus is mechanosensitive as well, which is not surprising given its substantial size in T cells \cite{McGregor2016}, taking up almost 90\% of the cell volume \cite{Strokotov2009. T cell forces are mechanotransduced through the lamina, a network of lamin and lamin-binding proteins that are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton \cite{Rossy2018, Enyedi2017, Dahl2008). When T cells migrate, squeezing and stretching can deform the nucleus, which triggers mechano-sensitive receptors located on the nuclear membrane.

Eicosanoids are proinflammatory cytokines that regulate a number of T lymphocyte functions. There is significant therapeutic focus in targeting these pathways, and future research may be interested in incorporating mechanical dimensions of T cell activation into their therapeutic strategies. 

- t cell nucleus is mechanosennsitve -> derofmring it causes nucleus-specific mechanosignaling -> one of those mechanosignals is secretion fo eicosanoids -> these are proinfalmmatory -> use it for t cell therapy!

\cite{Enyedi2017, Lone2013, Rossy2018}

\section{\textit{La fin}}

A number of outstanding questions surrounding T cell mechanobiology remain open for investigation. These questions remain unanswered today for either knowledge or technically-based reasons, but they will surely be answered in due time.
